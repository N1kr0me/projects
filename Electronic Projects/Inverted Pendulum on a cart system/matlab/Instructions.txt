Follow the below instructions to run the MATLAB CODE and the GUI animation.

1. Just copy the files which contains two ".m" files and one ".fig" file and paste the folder into any of the local disk drives.
2. Now open MATLAB and press "open" button in the MATLAB window and select the above folder name and select the two ".m" files having name "InvertedPendulum.m" 
and "inv_pend_ani.m" and then press the "open" button and so in the MATLAB Editor window two ".m" files will be opened containing the MATLAB code.
3. Now, go to the "EDITOR" option in the MATLAB window and press the "Run" button for both ".m" files respectively.
4. And then , the desired outputs and graphs will be obtained and also GUI animation window will be opened , so just feed the desired input values in GUI window to obtain the animation . 
5. In the GUI window first of all mark the "Reference Input" checkbox to correct steady-state errors common to full-state feedback systems and also for better visualization of the "Pendulum Angle" vs "Cart Position" graph plotting.
6. Further , detailed instructions about GUI Animation have been provided in the page no. "24" of the project report.
